Vision:
The AccessControl smart contract is designed to manage access permissions within a blockchain-based application. It provides a mechanism for an administrator to grant or revoke access rights to collaborators. This contract is ideal for applications requiring controlled access, such as collaborative platforms, multi-user environments, or permission-based systems.
